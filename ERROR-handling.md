Raising vs. Handling an Error: The Fire Alarm Analogy üö®
Think of exceptions like a fire alarm system.

raise: Pulling the Fire Alarm
The job of your lock_doors() method is to perform a task. If it detects a critical problem (like the car being in DRIVE), its only responsibility is to stop everything and signal danger. It does this by raiseing an exception. This is like pulling the fire alarm. The method itself doesn't know how to handle the fire; it just sounds the alarm.

try...except: The Firefighter's Plan
The code that calls the method (your main.py script) is like the firefighter. It knows an alarm might go off.

The try block is where the firefighter goes to work, attempting the risky action.

The except block is the plan for what to do when the alarm sounds. The goal is to handle the situation gracefully (e.g., log the error, print a message, try something else) so the whole program doesn't crash.

# Exception Handling Strategies

## 1. The Nuclear Option: Catch, Log, and Stop üõë
This is for critical, unrecoverable errors. If the program cannot possibly continue in a valid state, you should handle the error by logging it and then shutting the program down.

Analogy: The car's brake system fails its self-test. You don't just show a "Brake Error" message and let the person drive. You prevent the car from starting.

Example:

import sys

try:
    # Code to initialize something critical, like a database connection
    initialize_critical_system()
except CriticalError as e:
    print(f"FATAL ERROR: Cannot continue. {e}")
    sys.exit(1) # Exit the program with an error code

## 2. The Check Engine Light: Catch, Log, and Continue ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is for non-critical, recoverable errors. The program can continue to function, perhaps in a degraded state, but the user or system needs to be notified of the problem. Your lock_doors example falls into this category.

Analogy: The car's outside air temperature sensor fails. The car can still drive safely, but a "Check Engine" light comes on to log the issue.

Example: This is the pattern we've been discussing.

try:
    my_bcm.lock_doors()
except InvalidStateError as e:
    # This action failed, but the whole program can continue.
    print(f"Warning: {e}")

## 3. Passing the Blame: Catch, Clean Up, and Re-raise ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Sometimes, a function needs to catch an error to perform a specific cleanup action (like closing a file), but it doesn't know how to handle the error itself. In this case, it can perform its cleanup and then re-raise the exception for a higher-level part of the program to handle.

Analogy: The Plumber in a High-Rise üîß
Imagine a plumber is hired to install a new sink on the 10th floor of a high-rise building.

The try Block: The plumber starts the job, connecting the pipes for the new sink.

The Original Error: To test their work, they turn on the water, but a major pipe behind the wall bursts due to a pre-existing fault. The plumber can't fix a burst main; that's not their job.

The except Block (Catching the Error): The plumber immediately recognizes the critical error.

The Cleanup Action: Before doing anything else, their first responsibility is to shut off the local water valve directly under the sink they were working on. This "cleans up" their immediate area and prevents further flooding from their work.

The raise (Re-raising the Error): After shutting off the local valve, they immediately get on the radio and call the building's chief engineer. They report the original, bigger problem ("The main pipe on the 10th floor has burst!"). The chief engineer can now handle the crisis by shutting off water to the entire building and calling in a specialized team.

Example:

try:
    # some risky code
except SomeError as e:
    # Do some local cleanup here
    print("Cleaning up resources...")
    raise # Re-raise the same exception for the caller to handle
